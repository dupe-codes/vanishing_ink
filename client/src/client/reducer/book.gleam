/// RACE — `BookSettingsLoaded` arrives asynchronously after the
/// `fetch_book_settings` effect below. This helper flips to the
/// reader on the same frame, so the reader can edit a slider in the
/// window between the helper running and the GET response landing. A
/// slider drag during that window routes through `persist_target` →
/// `PersistBook(id)` (view is `Reader`, `active_book_id` is
/// `Some(id)`), so the user's edit lands on `book_settings` and PUTs
/// to the server. The in-flight GET response then arrives and
/// `apply_book_settings_loaded` overwrites `book_settings` with the
/// pre-PUT server snapshot, clobbering the just-applied user edit
/// until the next slider drag re-PUTs it. The window is materially
/// wider than the parallel init-time race on `apply_settings_loaded`
/// because the reader is actively in the reader view and can
/// interact immediately. Closing this last-write-wins variant would
/// require a request-id (drop a stale `BookSettingsLoaded` response
/// if a PUT has fired since the GET was issued) or a "fetch sequence
/// number" gate; neither is wired up today.
///
/// The cousin race — late `BookSettingsLoaded` landing after the
/// reader has navigated to the library or opened a different book
/// — IS guarded against. The Msg carries the originating `book_id`,
/// and `apply_book_settings_loaded` drops the response when
/// `model.view != Reader` or `model.active_book_id != Some(book_id)`.
/// That covers the "open A → back → A's GET lands" path (the
/// previously documented "library now shows the prior book's
/// pacing" defect) and the "open A → back → open B → A's GET lands"
/// path (which would otherwise stamp A's overrides onto B's
